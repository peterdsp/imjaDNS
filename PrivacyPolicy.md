# Privacy Policy for imjaDNS

**Last Updated:** May 2025

imjaDNS does not collect, store, or share any personal data.

The app allows users to view, manage, and apply DNS profiles locally on their device using Apple's `NEDNSSettingsManager`. All operations happen on-device and are controlled by the user.

No analytics, tracking, or logging is performed by the app. DNS changes occur through system APIs and require explicit user interaction in Settings.

We do not collect:
- IP addresses
- DNS queries
- Device identifiers
- Location data
- Any personally identifiable information (PII)

If you have any questions, feel free to contact **Petros Dhespollari** at info@peterdsp.dev.
